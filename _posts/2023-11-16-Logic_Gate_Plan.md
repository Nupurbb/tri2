# Plans for Logic Gates 

## Day by day plan 
Monday:
- Choose a group
- Choose a topic
- Brainstorm ideas for binary project 
Tuesday:
- Finalize idea for page 
- start to write a plan for the code
- use a tool to draw out your plan
Wednesday :
- start to write the code for the idea
Thursday:
- Start thinking about how to organize or structure the code
- Get started with the code and begin to practice presenting our ideation plan
Friday:
- Present our plans for the next week to Mr. Lopez
- Continue working on our code (struggle)

## Logic Gates Itself
- Logic gates are fundamental building blocks of digital circuits and form the basis of digital electronic systems. They are physical devices or electronic circuits that perform Boolean logic operations on binary inputs to produce a binary output. The most common types of logic gates include AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR gates. 
- Here's a brief overview of each:
    - AND: output it true (1) only if both inputs are true 
    - OR: output is true (1) if one or both inputs are true 
    - XNOR: output is true (1) if both inputs are true or both inputs are false 
    - XOR: output is true (1) if one input is true and one is false 

## Our Code 
- We want to design a code that is a digital representation of logic gates in circuitary to represent a how electricity travells through a circuit to turn on a lightbulb. By showing different colors of outputs, we can show how the different logic gates work.
